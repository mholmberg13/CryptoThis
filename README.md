# CryptoThis

CrptoThis is an app that connects to the CoinLore API and returns the current prices, rank, and change within the last 24 hours of some of the top cryptocurrencies. I have the cryptocurrencies listed within a div that expands on a click event and lists the data returning from the API. For the expanding divs I used an "animation" to make them slide out to a bigger size and you are able to collapse them on a seperate click event. This is a minimal viable product that I will be working to improve as class goes on.




# Issues

I want to make the api searchable by name and append the info inside of the expanding divs but I was having trouble with the name IDs in the API. Also my code is not dry yet but I will be working to fix that over the coming weeks.
